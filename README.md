# Generative AI for Bioinformatics: Exploring SeqGAN, ProteinGAN, and MolGAN

This repository explores the use of generative AI models in bioinformatics to create synthetic biological data. The project includes:

- **SeqGAN:** Generating synthetic DNA sequences.
- **ProteinGAN:** Designing novel protein sequences.
- **MolGAN:** Creating molecular graphs for drug discovery.

Each model is implemented in Google Colab with step-by-step experiments and visualizations. This work is part of my learning journey into generative AI and its applications in biology.
